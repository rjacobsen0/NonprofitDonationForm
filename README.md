# NonprofitDonationForm

Started a repository https://github.com/rjacobsen0/NonprofitDonationForm.git for this work. I've been using SVN,
not git, so I have a bit of learning to do to complete this.

Complete a hypothetical client request. A client has asked for a simple donation form on their Drupal 8 site.
The client already uses Stripe for processing payments at their events and would like to use it for the donation
form as well. The client needs to collect who is making the donation, how much itâ€™s for and of course collect
the credit card payment.
